## Etymology

The word banana is thought to be of West African origin, possibly from the [Wolof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolof_language) word *[banaana](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/banaana)*, and passed into English via Spanish or Portuguese.[[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-OEtymD-29)

The *Musa* 'Nendran' [cultivar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) grown widely in the Indian state of [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala) is a member of the [AAB cultivar group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banana_cultivars#AAB_Group)

The genus *[Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_(genus))* was created by [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) in 1753.[[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-WCSP_Musa-30) The name may be derived from [Antonius Musa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonius_Musa), physician to the Emperor [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), or Linnaeus may have adapted the Arabic word for banana, *[mauz](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/موز)*.[[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-HyamPank95-31) According to Roger Blench, the ultimate origin of *musa* is in the [Trans–New Guinea languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans–New_Guinea_languages), whence they were borrowed into the [Austronesian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages) and across Asia, via the [Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages) of India, into Arabic as a *[Wanderwort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderwort)*.[[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-32)

*Musa* is in the family [Musaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musaceae). The [APG III system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APG_III_system) assigns Musaceae to the order [Zingiberales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zingiberales), part of the [commelinid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commelinid) clade of the [monocotyledonous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocotyledon) flowering plants. Some 70 species of *Musa* were recognized by the [World Checklist of Selected Plant Families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Checklist_of_Selected_Plant_Families) as of January 2013;[[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-WCSP_Musa-30) several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.[[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-Bail16-33)

The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food: *Musa sapientum* for dessert bananas and *Musa paradisiaca* for [plantains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantain_(true)). More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number of [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) in the primary center of diversity of the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to be [synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)).[[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEValmayorJamaluddinSilayoiKusumo2000-34)

In a series of papers published from 1947 onwards, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus's *Musa sapientum* and *Musa paradisiaca* were cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species, *[Musa acuminata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_acuminata)* and *[Musa balbisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_balbisiana)*, both first described by [Luigi Aloysius Colla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Aloysius_Colla).[[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-DRC-35) Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of *Musa balbisiana*, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics of *Musa acuminata*, and those with characteristics of both.[[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-FOOTNOTEValmayorJamaluddinSilayoiKusumo2000-34) Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.[[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-DRC-35)[[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-Porc02-36)

The accepted [scientific names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanical_name) for most groups of cultivated bananas are *Musa acuminata* Colla and *Musa balbisiana* Colla for the ancestral species, and *Musa* × *paradisiaca* L. for the hybrid *M. acuminata* × *M. balbisiana*.[[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-WCSP_Mp-37)

[Synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)) of *M.* × *paradisiaca* include

- many subspecific and varietal names of *M.* × *paradisiaca*, including *M. p.* subsp. *sapientum* (L.) Kuntze
- *Musa* × *dacca* Horan.
- *Musa* × *sapidisiaca* K.C.Jacob, nom. superfl.
- *Musa* × *sapientum* L., and many of its varietal names, including *M.* × *sapientum* var. *paradisiaca* (L.) Baker, nom. illeg.

Generally, modern classifications of banana cultivars follow Simmonds and Shepherd's system. Cultivars are placed in groups based on the number of chromosomes they have and which species they are derived from. Thus the [Latundan banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latundan_banana) is placed in the AAB Group, showing that it is a triploid derived from both *M. acuminata* (A) and *M. balbisiana* (B). For a list of the cultivars classified under this system, *see* "[List of banana cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banana_cultivars)".

In 2012, a team of scientists announced they had achieved a draft sequence of the genome of *[Musa acuminata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_acuminata)*.[[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana#cite_note-dHon12-38)
