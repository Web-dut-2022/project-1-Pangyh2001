## Etymology

Main article: [Orange (word)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(word))

The word *orange* derives from the [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) word for "orange tree" (नारङ्ग *nāraṅga*), which in turn derives from a [Dravidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages) root word (compare நரந்தம்/നാരങ്ങ *narandam/naranja* which refers to [Bitter orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_orange) in [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) and [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam)).[[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Collins-29) The Sanskrit word reached [European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe) through [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language) نارنگ (*nārang*) and its [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language) derivative نارنج (*nāranj*).

The word entered [Late Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_English) in the fourteenth century via [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French) *orenge* (in the phrase *pomme d'orenge*).[[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-30) The French word, in turn, comes from [Old Provençal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Occitan) *auranja*, based on Arabic *nāranj*.[[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Collins-29) In several languages, the initial *n* present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because it may have been mistaken as part of an indefinite article ending in an *n* sound—in French, for example, *une norenge* may have been heard as *une orenge*. This linguistic change is called [juncture loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juncture_loss). [The color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(color)) was named after the fruit,[[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-31) and the first recorded use of *orange* as a color name in English was in 1512.[[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-32)[[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-33)

The sweet orange is not a wild fruit,[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-webber4-17) having arisen in domestication from a cross between a non-pure [mandarin orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_orange) and a hybrid [pomelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomelo) that had a substantial mandarin component. Since its chloroplast DNA is that of pomelo, it was likely the hybrid pomelo, perhaps a BC1 pomelo [backcross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcrossing), that was the maternal parent of the first orange.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-genealogy_review-7)[[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Wu-34) Based on genomic analysis, the relative proportions of the ancestral species in the sweet orange is approximately 42% pomelo and 58% mandarin.[[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Talon-35) All varieties of the sweet orange descend from this original cross, differing only by mutations selected for during agricultural propagation.[[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Wu-34) Sweet oranges have a distinct origin from the bitter orange, which arose independently, perhaps in the wild, from a cross between pure mandarin and pomelo parents.[[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-Wu-34) The earliest mention of the sweet orange in Chinese literature dates from 314 B.C.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-fullgenome-2)

In Europe, the [Moors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors) introduced the orange to the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula) which was known as [Al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus), with large scale cultivation starting in the 10th century as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques specifically adapted to support orange orchards.[[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-36) Citrus fruits — among them the bitter orange — were introduced to Sicily in the 9th century during the period of the [Emirate of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Sicily), but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-morton-10) Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It also was considered a luxury item and wealthy people grew oranges in private conservatories, called [orangeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangerie). By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-morton-10) [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV) of France had a great love of orange trees, and built the grandest of all royal [Orangeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangerie_of_Versailles) at the [Palace of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles).[[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-37) At Versailles potted orange trees in solid silver tubs were placed throughout the rooms of the palace, while the Orangerie allowed year-round cultivation of the fruit to supply the court. When Louis condemned his finance minister, [Nicolas Fouquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Fouquet), in 1664, part of the treasures which he confiscated were over 1,000 orange trees from Fouquet's estate at [Vaux-le-Vicomte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaux-le-Vicomte).[[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-38)

Spanish travelers introduced the sweet orange into the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493, Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit in Hispaniola.[[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-39) Subsequent expeditions in the mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when [Pedro Menéndez de Avilés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Menéndez_de_Avilés) founded [St Augustine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Augustine,_Florida). [Spanish missionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_missions_in_Arizona) brought orange trees to Arizona between 1707 and 1710, while the [Franciscans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_missions_in_California) did the same in San Diego, California, in 1769.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-morton-10) An orchard was planted at the [San Gabriel Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_San_Gabriel_Arcángel) around 1804 and a commercial orchard was established in 1841 near present-day Los Angeles. In Louisiana, oranges were probably introduced by French explorers.

[Archibald Menzies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Menzies), the botanist and naturalist on the [Vancouver Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Expedition), collected orange seeds in South Africa, raised the seedlings onboard and gave them to several Hawaiian chiefs in 1792. Eventually, the sweet orange was grown in wide areas of the Hawaiian Islands, but its cultivation stopped after the arrival of the [Mediterranean fruit fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratitis_capitata) in the early 1900s.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-morton-10)[[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-40)

As oranges are rich in [vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_C) and do not spoil easily, during the [Age of Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery), [Portuguese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_empire), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_empire), and [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_empire) sailors planted citrus trees along trade routes to prevent [scurvy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy).

Florida farmers obtained seeds from New Orleans around 1872, after which orange groves were established by grafting the sweet orange on to sour orange rootstocks.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#cite_note-morton-10)
